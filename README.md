# MOMIBB
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Multiobjective Mixed-Integer Branch-and-Bound Algorithm (MOMIBB).
It allows to solve both convex and nonconvex multiobjective mixed-integer optimization problems.

## Getting Started
You can start using MOMIBB by downloading or cloning this repository using the green button near the top of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/MOMIBB).
Then, just open the [UserFile.m](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/MOMIBB/blob/main/UserFile.m).
It serves as an interface to the MOMIBB algorithm and provides all instructions that you need to get started.
